## ⚠️ Experimental / Under Development

### Advanced AI Analysis
- **Status**: Extensive type definitions and interfaces exist
- **Reality**: Most implementations are stubs or placeholder code
- **Issue**: Claims "deep semantic understanding" but provides basic pattern matching

### Security Analysis
- **Status**: Pattern-based vulnerability detection implemented
- **Reality**: High false positive rate, limited real-world effectiveness
- **Issue**: Claims "enterprise-grade" but lacks comprehensive testing

### Smart Refactoring
- **Status**: Basic code smell detection working
- **Reality**: Suggestions are generic and often not actionable
- **Issue**: Claims "intelligent automated improvements" but provides basic analysis

### Dependency Analysis
- **Status**: Infrastructure exists for multiple package managers
- **Reality**: Often returns 0 dependencies, limited real functionality
- **Issue**: Claims "comprehensive analysis" but has significant gaps

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Parsing (Working)
```rust
use rust_tree_sitter::{Parser, Language};

let parser = Parser::new(Language::Rust)?;
let tree = parser.parse("fn main() {}", None)?;
println!("Root: {}", tree.root_node().kind()); // "source_file"
```

### Tree Navigation (Working)
```rust
let functions = tree.find_nodes_by_kind("function_item");
for func in functions {
    if let Some(name) = func.child_by_field_name("name") {
        println!("Function: {}", name.text()?);
    }
}
```

### Language Detection (Working)
```rust
use rust_tree_sitter::detect_language_from_path;

if let Some(lang) = detect_language_from_path("main.rs") {
    println!("Detected: {}", lang.name()); // "Rust"
}
```

### Queries (Mostly Working)
```rust
use rust_tree_sitter::Query;

let query = Query::new(Language::Rust, "(function_item) @function")?;
let matches = query.matches(&tree)?;
println!("Found {} functions", matches.len());
```
