# ðŸš€ **Implementation Plan: Mock to Production-Grade Code**

## **Executive Summary**

Transform the rust-tree-sitter library from 52% functional to **100% production-grade** by implementing real analysis engines, integrating external services, and building comprehensive testing infrastructure. This plan converts all mock/framework code into fully functional, tested, and validated professional implementations.
