# Implementation Plan: Future Development Roadmap

**‚ö†Ô∏è SPECULATIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN - NOT CURRENT REALITY**

## Executive Summary

This document outlines **potential future development** for the rust-tree-sitter library.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**
- This is a **speculative roadmap**, not a commitment or timeline
- Current implementation is basic tree-sitter parsing with experimental features
- Time estimates are rough approximations and may not be accurate
- Many features described here are **aspirational** and not currently implemented
- This plan does not guarantee any specific functionality will be delivered

**Current Reality:** The library provides basic tree-sitter parsing and limited analysis capabilities. Most advanced features are placeholder implementations or basic pattern matching.
